# NumberRecognition

A neural network used to recognize numbers, trained on the MNIST dataset. 
This project includes a drawing interface that allows users to draw digits and see the model's predictions in real-time.
Going from a solution using tensorflow frameworks to a manually implemented network. The accuracy when using tensorflow was about 97% (4 epochs, v0).
The accuracy of the latest neural network is: 

## Features

- Draw digits on a canvas 10x larger than the MNIST format (280x280), making it easier to draw.
- Press **'p'** to make a prediction.
- Press **'c'** to clear the board.

## Usage

1. Run the drawing interface script.
2. Draw a digit in the window.
3. Press **'p'** to see the model's prediction on the screen.
4. Press **'c'** to clear and try again. 
5. The model will display the predicted digit
